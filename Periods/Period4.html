	<h3> Summary </h3>

	<p>

	This time period marked an expansion of traditional American values established
	early on. One was the expansion westward and continuing of the American dream of 
	opportunities. They continued their pursuit of Native Americans and continued their
	want to remove European presence.
	Another was the expansion of democratic ideals under Jacksonian Democracy and
	pushes for equalities by women and abolitionists. These pushes for equality were
	founded on a callback to colonial Christian values in what is called the Second
	Great Awakening. As these expansions occurred, an original American culture starts
	developing. Besides these reinvigorations of traditions, America experienced a wave
	of industrialization and economic growth known as the Market Revolution. With it, new
	gender roles were set and the North, West, and South developed distinct regional
	economies. However, these differences in regional economics proved difficult to
	merge politically. During this time, American politics continued down a path of 
	sectionalism and rigid voting patterns. At the end of this time period, growing
	westward expansion intensifies calls for greater democracies, expansion of equalities,
	growing regional economic specification, and sectional politics.

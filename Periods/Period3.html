	<h3> Summary </h3>

	<p>

	This revolutionary time period started with a strong alliance between the colonists
	and the British in the French and Indian War (7 Years' War) to gain economic 
	advantages as and more land. The British plummeted into debt due to the war expenses
	and looked to establish a more hands on, mercantilist governance of the colonies.
	Such changes included taxes and suppression of colonists, and had greatly reversed
	the past policy of salutary neglect. As a newfound sense of unity emerged around the
	colonists calling for an American revolution,
	others became increasingly loyalist, lamenting the large impact of the war.
	In the end, the Patriots won out with French military aid and under
	the leadership of General George
	Washington. Needing a new government, America struggled to capture the demands of all
	the Patriots, creating a weak Articles of Confederation and after, a highly contested
	U.S. Constitution. Setting sail with George Washington as the first President, 
	America enjoyed a smooth start, but in light of the French Revolution and 
	controversies over the definition of the Constitution, America ended this time period
	split.

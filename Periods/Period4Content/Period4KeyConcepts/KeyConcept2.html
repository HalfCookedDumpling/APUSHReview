	<h4> How did new technologies expand production? </h4>

	<p>

	During this time, America experienced a market revolution. This had brought new
	transportation systems, communication networks, industrial technologies and 
	agricultural technologies. All of these increased the rate of production and
	transportation of goods in their respective regions, but there was largely a disconnect
	of the Southern Cotton Kingdom from the rest of the countries economy. 

	</p>

	<p>

	For the Northern factories, the spinning Jenny and interchangeable parts greatly
	increased production. For the South, the cotton gin, steel plow, and McCormick
	Reaper had increased the speed of cotton production.

	</p>

	<p>

	America's production increases were linked with new transportation and networks.
	The telegraph and morse code were prominent inventions which further connected
	America. In terms of transportation, the government had put subsidies into internal
	improvements, as in the American system. Such funds were given to create the National
	Cumberland road, the Erie Canal, and the B&O Railroad. Steamboats were also created
	during this time and helped navigate canals or go upstream in the Mississippi
	River. Although these transportation networks had greaty connected the Mid West
	with the Northeast, the South was largely left out from these networks, which were
	projects focused more on the North.

	</p>

	<h4> How did the Market Revolution change the lives of Americans? </h4>

	<p>

	In the North, many more men and women moved into factory work settings instead of
	the colonial times of small crafts and subsistence. This can be seen with the Lowell
	girls in the Lowell Mills. Many of the goods produced in these factories were 
	transported to distant markets through the new transportation systems. This transition
	to the factory setting created a new socio-economic class revolving around poor
	laborers, middle class managers, and elite factory owners. There was significant
	wealth inequality between the laborers and elite despite an increasing standard of 
	living.

	</p>

	<p>

	Despite the earlier Lowell girls and women working in factories, that was mostly true
	for the low class laboring class. In the growing middle class, the expectation for
	middle class women was to stay at home. This idea of "Cult of Domesticity" was one
	that emphasized men in the working sphere and women in the house.

	</p>

	<h4> How did economic growth accompany regional development? </h4>

	<p>

	With industrialization and factories rising in prominence in the North, the Northern
	economy specialized in manufacturing. During the Irish Potato Famine, many Irish
	immigrants moved into these Northeastern cities to work as laborers. Their economy
	was linked greatly with the Mid West and the Ohio area. With a manufacturing base,
	the North had supported tariffs for their industry and further connectivity to
	the Mid West through internal improvements.

	</p>

	<p>

	The South developed what was a Cotton Kingdom. They based their economy on slave
	labor and plantations. Although some of the raw cotton produced here were sent to
	Northern textile factories through the Mississippi, most of it was sold to the 
	European market. The South's agriculture had much less benefit from the tariffs, and
	so many disliked tariffs as it ended up making them pay more. The South was also
	much less connected through the transportation networks and had waning support
	for internal improvements.

	</p>

	<p>

	The Mid West consisted of smaller farm economies. Many of the people living on the
	Western frontiers had been German immigrants, and they were able to provide food
	to the Northeastern region through the transportation networks. The West had benefits
	from the transportation networks between them and the Northeast and continued to 
	support internal improvements.

	</p>

	<p>

	With all these different economies, the American system was used to foster a 
	national unity and connectivity. This included a national bank, tariffs, and internal
	improvements. The North and West had supported the American system but the South
	did not due to the lack of benefits.

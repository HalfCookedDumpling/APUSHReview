	<h4> How did new popular culture emerge and cause controversies? </h4>

	<p>

	In this time period, especially during the 1920s, new forms of media emerged through
	radios and cinema. Father Charles Coughlin, a Christian, hosted a largely successful
	radio show and FDR had regularly used radio broadcasts for his fireside chats. 
	Five cent movies had become popular especially during the Great Depression which
	were called Nickelodeons. Other movies have now been made with audio, the first of 
	which was "Jazz Singer." Besides these American expressions popular culture, Jewish
	Yiddish Theaters emerged and had influenced America's own development of theatrics.

	</p>

	<p>

	With the Great Migration towards Northern cities, African Americans were also 
	expressing their unique culture. This phenomenon is called the Harlem Renaissance
	and featured an African American expression of culture. This can be seen with the
	poetry by Langston Hughes or the writing of Zora Hurston.

	</p>

	<p>

	Although culture was blooming, America had experienced restrictions to these newfound
	expressions during and after WWI. This can be seen in the restriction of freedom of 
	speech in the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 which silenced 
	opposition to the war effort. Due to the Bolshevik Revolution, Americans were scared
	of radicalism and communism, and so
	nativist campaigns like the Palmer Raid and the re-emergence of the KKK created what
	is called the Red Scare. Immigration had been limited in the Emergency Quota Act
	and the National Origins act harshly, allowing only two percent of a country's 
	immigrants to come in.

	</p>

	<p>

	In the 1920 census, it reported that for the first time, more people were living in
	cities than in rural areas. As the breeding ground of culture, cities had also bred
	controversies concerning traditional values. One such value was the idea of the cult
	of domesticity or republican motherhood, which sought to lock women away from society.
	This was challenged by the emergence of flappers, women who wore shorter dresses,
	smoked, and drank. Furthermore, the growing sense of modernism lessened the autonomy
	of workers as they were just another machine in the assembly line. Another modern
	idea clashed with traditional Christian values in the Scopes Trial,
	a case where a teacher of evolution was charged for teaching evolution. Regarding
	race, the expression of culture and the Great Migration had caused conflicting
	cultures, which resulted in Race Riots in cities like Chicago. Immigrant cultures
	also caused controversy as in the Sacco and Venzetti trial, where two Italian men
	were given in an unfair trial leading to their death. While this time had
	brought many new forms and expressions of cultures, they had also had to clash with
	past cultures.

	</p>

	<h4> How did America react to international and internal migrants? </h4>

	<p>

	Leading up to WWI, the immigration from Europe had shifted from Irish and German to
	more Southern and Eastern Europeans like Italians and Polish. After the War, nativism
	emerged with the KKK, Emergency Quota Act, and National Origins Act, which all
	opposed immigrants.

	</p>

	<p>

	However, during the wars, internal migrants had started flooding the cities for job
	opportunities, like people in central America moving out to the Western cities of 	
	California as depicted in "Grapes of Wrath."

	</p>

	<p>

	African Americans didn't have the share the same welcoming arms in the cities.
	With the Great Migration to escape segregation, lynchings, the KKK, and for 
	economic opportunity, African Americans found that the North and the West still
	persistently discriminated against them.

	</p>

	<p>

	Mexican immigrants had faced both discrimination and support for immigrating to 
	America. During the Great Depression, many Mexicans were deported to create jobs
	for Anglo-Americans. However, for the full mobilization effort in WWII, the Bracero
	program had encouraged Mexicans to immigrate and join in the American labor force.

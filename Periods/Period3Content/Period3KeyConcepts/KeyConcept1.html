	Key Concept 3.1 - British attempts to assert tighter control over its North American

	<h4> How did the French and Indian War alter the power distribution in North America? </h4>
	
	<p>

	Leading up to the French and Indian War, the British and the colonists itched to
	expand westward especially into the French Ohio Valley. Due to this and the British
	alliance with the Iroquois Confederacy, tensions emerged and both European powers
	looked to contest the territory. After British victory, France was largely removed
	from North America and conceded a huge amount of land to Britain. consequently,
	the colonists looked to 
	push westward and engaged in conflicts such as the native American Pontiac's 
	Rebellion and the Paxton Boys.

	</p>

	<p>

	Conflicting with the natives, the colonists were soon restricted by the British,
	which were dealing with large war debts. The colonists had lost their power to 
	expand westward with the Proclamation of 1763, a restriction on moving past the 
	Appalachians. Furthermore, they started creating taxes for revenue with the sugar act,
	Stamp Act, and the Townsend acts. This marked the end of salutary neglect, the 
	previous policy of the British to keep colonial autonomy as long as they were 
	economically beneficial.

	</p>

	<h4> How did colonists react to British imperialism? </h4>

	<p>

	Tightening their control over the colonies, the British faced much resistance from
	the colonists. In response to the sugar acts, many people smuggled in sugar to
	bypass the taxes. In response to the tea acts, the colonists, under the leadership
	of Samuel Adams, participated in the Boston Tea Party. The most important resistance
	was to the Stamp Act, which gave the famed maxim "no taxation without representation."
	Another resistance to British imperialism was throwing rocks at British soldiers
	stationed due to the Quartering Act. A couple of these acts were repealed by the
	British, but Americans kept on resisting the constant flow of new acts. A big
	outcome of these successful repeals was a strenghtening unity among the colonists.

	</p>

	<p>

	Despite the glory of American resistance to the British, their reasonings were
	fairly founded on European and British ideals. Their reactions were largely 
	influenced by the European Enlightenment and the rights of a British subjects. 
	A major Enlightnment influence was that of John Locke, which argued about the 
	natural rights of man. They also believed as a British subject, they deserved the
	right to actual representation over virtual representation. Coupled with the 
	previous colonial self-rule seen in the House of Burgesses and Fundamental Orders of
	Connecticut, colonists justified their resistances.

	</p>

	<p>

	With these ideas floating around American resistances, large figures stepped up to
	lead the colonists. Radical patriots like Samuel Adams had garnered much support
	for the Revolutionary cause. His cousin, John Adams, had been much more conservative	
	in his approach but had also lead the Stamp Act Congress. It is important to keep in
	mind that although there were largescale resistances to British imperialism, it
	wasn't until Thomas Paine's Common Sense that the colonists called for independence.
	This was seen with the First Continental Congress calling for resistance but not
	independence and the Olive Branch Petition. After the mass public support from 
	Common Sense, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and John Adams had set out to write
	the Declaration Independence. It was greatly influenced by the natural rights of 
	John Locke as can be seen in its famous line:

	</p>

	<p id = "longQuote"> 

	We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they 
	are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are 
	life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

	</p>


	<p>

	During the war, a major advantage the Patriots had was full commitment and 
	mobilization efforts. The British hadn't committed too much to keep control of the
	colonies. Patriots also had strong military leadership under George Washington
	and homefront familiarity advantage, but the most important advantage was the foreign
	help from France. Before the Battle of Saratoga, Patriots were staring down against
	the strongest navy in the world and an economic powerhouse. The crucial victory at
	the Battle of Saratoga convinced the French that Americans could win against Britain,
	and that chipping in to defeat their enemy would be plausible. After this, America
	was able to win the war and their independence.

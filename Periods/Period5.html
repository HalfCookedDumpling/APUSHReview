	<h3> Summary </h3>

	<p>

	This era was most notably marked by hunger for land in the west. While new opportunites
	arised in the west economically, politically, it had caused major tension over the
	extension of slavery into these new territories. This failure to unify the rapidly
	expanding country led the United States into extreme regional alliances, culminating
	in the Civil War. Both sides of the war, the Northern Union and Southern Confederacy,
	had rapidly mobilized their populations and economies. However, the North's material
	advantage and the lack of foreign support for the Southern cause ended in Union victory
	under the leadership of General Grant, General Sherman, and President Lincoln. After
	the war, the country strived to bring changes to different regions of the country,
	most notably reconstructing the South to share more similar sentiments with the North.
	However, Southern resistance and the North's waning resolve to reconstruct the South
	had ended the era with three distinctly different regions that had huge economic
	and functional differences.

	<h4> Key Concepts </h4>

	<ul>

		<li> 

		<a href = "Period5Content\Period5KeyConcepts\KeyConcept1.html"> 5.1 </a>

		- The United States became more connected with the world, pursued an 
		expansionist foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere, and emerged as the
		destination for many migrants from other countries. 

		</li>

		<li>

		<a href = "Period5Content\Period5KeyConcepts\KeyConcept2.html"> 5.2 </a>

		- Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over
		slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation
		into a civil war.

		</li>

		<li>

		<a href = "Period5Content\Period5KeyConcepts\KeyConcept3.html"> 5.3 </a>

		- The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested reconstruction of the
		South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many
		questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.

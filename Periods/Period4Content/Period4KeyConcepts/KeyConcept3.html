	Key Concept 4.3 - The U.S. interest in increasing foreign trade and expanding its

	<h4> How did the U.S. seek to control the Americas? </h4>

	<p>

	After the Louisiana purchase, America started to try to control the west. This was
	first seen with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which tried to map out the North
	American continent. They had also engaged in armed conflicts such as the Aroostook
	war with Britain to settle border conflicts in Maine. Another armed conflict was that
	of the Indian Removal Acts. This was used to force Native Americans out of supposed
	U.S. territory. One big way they tried to exert control over the Americas was through
	the Monroe Doctrine. This warned Europeans to not approach the Americas, establishing
	the U.S. as the controlling power in the Western Hemisphere. This in turn also promised
	to keep the U.S. out of European affairs.

	</p>

	<p>

	Further expansion into the West was strongly supported by frontier settlers. Many of 
	these people had wanted more land for farming specifically. However, they had to
	contest Natives for their land. In this time, multiple native conflicts emerged, such
	as the Black Hawk War and the Seminole Wars.

	</p>

	<p>

	An important expression of American control is the rise of nativism in American
	culture. From this era on, American culture greatly uses racist, anti-catholic, or
	other justifications to suppress foreign and non anglo-saxon cultures. In this period,
	this can be seen through the the Know-Nothing Party, which was created to resist
	Irish immigration into the U.S.

	</p>


	<h4> How did westward expansion cause tensions over slavery? </h4>

	<p>

	Due to Cotton plantations damaging land greatly, the Southern plantation owners looked
	to expand westward for more land. With westward movement of plantations past the 
	Appalachians, slavery was brought with it into the new territories. In the North,
	there was growing antislavery sentiments, such as those by William Lloyd Garrison and
	Frederick Douglass. Despite 3/4 of the Southern population not owning slaves, there
	were arguments made supporting slavery, like John C. Calhoun's argument that slavery
	is a "positive good."

	</p>

	<p>

	In light of this expansion and controversies over the institution of slavery, the
	government tried to patch it up and create national unity with the Missouri 
	Compromise. The Missouri Compromise had admitted Maine as a free state and Missouri
	as a slave state, and drew a line which slavery and free states would be determined.
	This only held the nation together temporarily. A critic of this was Jefferson, which
	argued that drawing a geographical line for slavery will only split the nation further.
	This prediction by Jefferson evidently turned out to be correct.

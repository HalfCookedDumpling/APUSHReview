	<h4> Why did the United States economy experience so much industrial growth? </h4>

	<p>

	One way the United States looked to expand their economy was in government subsidies
	to transportation. This can be seen with the funds for the Union Pacific Railroad
	and the Central Pacific Railroad. The resources required for these railroads led to
	an increasing demand for steel and oil, which both became booming markets in the 
	United States. Another way expansion of the economy through connectivity was the 
	creation of the Telephone by Alexander Graham Bell. This had opened up the telephone
	market, one which would give birth to the company AT&T. 

	</p>

	<p>

	With increased connectivity and technologies, new businesses came to dominate the
	American economy. Carnegie Steel had dominated the Steel and railroad industry,
	using a corporate consolidation technique called vertical integration, an attempt to
	control the manufacturing of a product from start to finish. Standard Oil by 
	Rockefeller had dominated the oil businesses, and they mainly used the technique of
	horizontal integration, an attempt to buy out all competitors in a specific industry.
	Both of these companies had used trusts, an amalgamation of many similar-interested
	corporations to increase their collective power. With massive corporations becoming
	monopolistic, they sought mass amounts of labor to help with production. They had
	utilized an idea called Taylorism, which was to divide the creation of a product
	into smaller simple steps and distribute these jobs to workers. This greatly inproved
	efficiency in factories.

	</p>

	<p>

	Increased production brought multiple changes to American lifestyles. Many goods
	were produced for cheaper due to increased efficiency and wages for many workers 
	increased. America's overall standard of living improved especially with new technologies
	like the light bulb. With new products flooding the market, department stores were
	created, the first of which was Sears. These stores gave Americans greatly increased
	access to products, especially those that were not made locally and shipped in. There
	was an emergence of a consumer culture, especially in the middle class, which had 
	bought items like sporting equipment that where not necessary, but were for entertainment.
	One negative impact of this industrial economic growth was the increasing wage gap
	between the rich and the poor.

	</p>

	<p>

	The expanding economy also looked overseas for new markets or resources. This can be
	seen with the want to annex Hawaii for sugar. In Latin America, they had created a
	"Big Brother" policy to open their markets to American goods. This opening of markets
	internationally had also contributed to the large American economic growth.

	</p>

	<h4> Why did people react differently to the economy? </h4>

	<p>

	During this time, many Americans had looked at the economy as a byproduct of 
	Laissez-Faire policies, and continued supporting it. This was the idea that the 
	government should play a minimal, if not nonexistant, role in the economy. This is
	extremely influential and created the basis for the capitalist society that American
	became. In the future, especially in the 1920s, this ideology was one that many had
	looked to fall back on.

	</p>

	<p> 

	With the North booming in industrialization, Southern farmers had moved to the cities
	in the North for labor work. Besides farmers, international migrants had filled
	the labor market, known as "new immigrants" which consisted of the Chinese, Southern
	Europeans, and Eastern Europeans. Many poor families
	had also relied on children for an income and child labor grew during this time. These
	groups already had lower pays than American born adult workers, and the influx of more
	of them had lowered the wages for mostly everyone.

	</p>

	<p>

	Due to these newfound labor conditions, labor unions became a prominent response to
	the economy. This can be seen with the Knights of Labor formed by Terence Powderly,
	which included skilled laborers, unskilled laborers, women, and African Americans.
	Another was the American Federation of Labor
	under Samuel Gompers, which consisted of only skilled laborers.
	Labor Unions had organized their powers through strikes, such as the Pullman Strike,
	Homestead Strike, and the Haymarket Strike. These movements by these labor unions
	had established a standardized 8-hour working days and compensation for injury but
	failed to create other improvements. An example of their shortcomings was the fact
	that these strikes were stopped by government supported strike breaker campaigns and
	that after the Haymarket Strike, fears of anarchy had crumbled the Knights of Labor.

	</p>

	<p>

	While the Northern factory societies were caught in a limbo between wanting 
	Laissez-Faire policies and labor unions calling for government protections and 
	regulations to benefit and protect workers, the South had a different reaction.
	Some in the South had argued for a "New South," which had industrialization in its
	future. This was seen in the appearance of textile factories, however most of the 
	Southern economy still revolved around agriculture, particularly tenant farming 
	taking the forms of sharecropping and the crop lien system. 

	</p>

	<h4> How did industrial growth impact farmers? </h4>

	<p>

	Industrial technologies had greatly improved the productivity. These technologies
	included tractors, reapers, and grain elevators all increased production and 
	transportation of crops. This led to dropping prices of crops and an increased
	dependence on the railroads to transport the mass amounts of produce. Due to this,
	farmers had attacked the consolidation of railroads and created their own
	organizations. The Grange was one influential organization at the local level that
	had tried to elect representatives that supported the farmer's ideals and establish
	restrictions on the railroad monopolies. Besides that, the Southern Farmer's Alliance
	was formed to also create local resistances to the economy. 

	</p>

	<p>

	These local impacts on farmers culminated into the national effort by the Populist
	Party. Farmers were the main demographic that supported this party which was mostly
	led by William Jennings Bryan. They advocated for more government control over the 
	railroads due to the monopolies that existed, income tax that increased for the 
	wealthy, direct election of senators, and the
	concept of bimedalism. Combined with the economic panics of 1873 and 1893, many
	farmers had increasingly rejected the Gold Standard and wanted to inflate the 
	economy by introducing silver to reduce their struggles with debt.

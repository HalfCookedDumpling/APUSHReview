	<h4> How did overseas expansion cause debates over America's international role? </h4>

	<p>

	With Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis, which argued that the Western Frontier
	closing would limit America's opportunities, new arguments emerged for overseas
	expansion to renew the American dream of opportunity. When
	given the chance, America quickly took over Hawaii. Imperialists argued that the 
	the expansion and conquering of Hawaii was just the natural extension to the Manifest
	Destiny it had previously exercised. They also argued that taking over these 
	territories will give America more opportunities for natural resources or access to
	trade in the Pacific. Furthermore, the ideology of Social Darwinism was used to 
	justify American expansion as a way to enlighten "lesser races." This was evident in
	the poem "The White Man's Burden," which enforced that America has a job to liberate
	the world from savagery.

	</p>

	<p>

	Paralleling the imperialist arguments, a strong anti-imperialist opposition emerged.
	Anti-imperialists drew from the idea of self-determination, the idea that countries
	get to choose their own government. From this, they argued that others, like 
	Americans, deserve the right to self governance. Other anti-imperialists strongly
	held on to the American tradition of Isolationism, which was set in place by 
	Washington's Farewell Address.

	</p>

	<p>

	Defeating Spain in the Spanish American War, America quickly acquired the Philippines,
	Guam, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. With new territories in the Caribbean and Latin America,
	America had strengthened their presence with the Roosevelt Corollary. Despite 
	promising the Filipinos independence from imperialism, the US quickly turned to 
	suppress the uprisings lead by Emilio Eguinaldo.

	</p>

	<h4> How did WWI cause debates over America's international role? </h4>

	<p>

	WWI challenged America's tradition of isolationism. In the past, the Washington
	Farewell Address and the Monroe Doctrine had set strong precedents that the US
	should stay away from alliances and entanglements with European powers. Although
	America initially declared itself as neutral, it always leaned on the side of the
	allied forces as it consistenly traded with Britain. Turning the public opinion,
	events like the Zimmerman Telegraph and the sinking of Lusitania created anger
	and urged President Woodrow Wilson to enter the war to make the world safe for 
	democracy, as expressed in his fourteen points. Breaking the tradition of 
	isolationism, Wilson sent over the American
	Expeditionary Force in 1917 to Europe. Most American casualties during this war
	was due to disease instead of combat, and the war ended way faster than expected,
	showing that American forces played a limited role but was important to the allied 
	victory.

	</p>

	<p>

	After the war, Wilson persistently tried negotiating the Treaty of Versailles and
	the League of Nations to the Senate, but failed to pass either one. Wilson especially
	tried to push for joining the League of Nations as international institutions were
	a vital part of his fourteen points. However, the Senate retained the tradition for
	isolationism and refused to be caught in foreign alliances, especially within Europe.
	A senator, Henry Cabot Lodge, had also argued that joining the League of Nations
	would pass over some of Congress' power over to the League of Nations.

	</p>

	<p>

	Continuing down a path of isolationism after the war, America sought to continue a
	unilateral and self-focused international policy. They continued the idea of dollar
	diplomacy, the idea that the US will not engage in conflicts but instead try to 
	secure investments in other countries for banks. They also engaged in the 
	Kellogg-Briand Pact, which sought to reduce military confrontations, and the
	Washington Naval Conference, which restricted the amount of battleships the US,
	Britain, and Japan could build. However, America participated in particular
	interventions, like in Nicaragua, to maintain a sense of American power. During the
	Great Depression, FDR had passed two Neutrality Acts to cement American isolation.
	This influenced the rise of the America First Committee under Charles Lindbergh and
	the cement had held on for a little while.

	</p>

	<h4> How did WWII bring America into a position of international power? </h4>

	<p>

	The German Occupation of France, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Nazi concentration
	camps, and the Holocaust compelled America to join the WWII as a total war between
	Democracy and Fascism. Before declaring war, America had done much the same as it had
	in WWI, just producing supplies for the allies. The Lend-Lease Act was passed, which
	allowed America to lend supplies to Britain, a direct show that they were not at all
	neutral. However, America quickly picked up after Pearl Harbor and declared war on 
	the axis countries. 

	</p>

	<p>

	Joining WWII, America engaged in a full mobilization effort, leading to the immediate
	end to the Great Depression. America's strong industrial economy provided much need
	supplies to the allied troops, giving them a large advantage. During this time of
	mobilization, women and minorities were quickly able to improve their positions.
	Women quickly filled into industrial and health care jobs. Though still facing 
	segregation, African Americans had joined the ranks of other Americans in the 
	military and worked in factories. However, African Americans continued pushing for
	what was called the Double Victory Campaign, a win on the battlefield and a win
	for social equality. They achieved momentary ends to segregation with FDR's
	Executive Order 8802, which removed all segregation in the work place. Mexicans,
	under the Bracero program, had also been encouraged to join the labor force for
	the mobilization effort. The Chinese Exclusion Act was also repealed during WWII,
	loosening the nativist constructs of America. Despite all these advancements,
	Japanese Americans faced internment which was upheld in the court case 
	Korematsu vs US.

	</p>

	<p>

	The allied forces eventually won the war for a multitude of reasons. First, in
	the Tehran Conference, FDR, Churchill, and Stalin had strong cooperation in planning
	an attack on the peripheries of axis countries, then launching an offensive to 
	reclaim France. The second reason was that the allies had created superior 
	technologies and scientific advancements such as the Manhattan Project's atomic
	bombs, the use of Sonar detection, and the first modern computer by Alan Turing to
	decipher German message encryptions. The third reason was the US' strong industrial
	production and total mobilization which kept allied supplies replenishing. Lastly,
	well planned military tactics such as Island-Hopping and D-Day proved successful.
	With the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ending the war, conversations were sparked
	about the morality of atomic bombs and their ability to kill thousands of civilians.

	</p>

	<p>

	At the end of the war, Europe and Asia suffered major damage while America's economy
	was revived. To prevent another global armed confrontation, especially with atomic 
	bombs, America this time gave in and fully abandoned Washington's Farewell Address.
	The US joined the United Nations, serving as a permanent member of their security 
	council. America had at last made its way to the top.

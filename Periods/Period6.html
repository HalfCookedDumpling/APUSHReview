	<h3> Summary </h3>

	<p>

	This period is characterized by the massive change to America due to the expansion
	of industrialization. With new technologies and production methods, new companies
	came to dominate the American economy under a Laissez-Faire policy. Such massive
	companies had, however, created massive controversy in the community. While some
	had justified this through the ideas of Social Darwinism, others had criticized and
	fought against the monopolistic tendencies. Labor Unions were a massive form of 
	resistance to corporate power as the they push for better working conditions and pay.
	Others had also looked to confront corporate corruption in both national and local
	governments. The center of politics during this time was mostly around the extent
	of Laissez-Faire and how to limit the control of these big businesses.
	With these new industries and increased productions with companies, they needed to 
	hire many people. Many of the working class laborers had been filled by international
	and internal migrants, and many middle-class managerial positions also emerged. As a
	result, American cultures, distinctly created by their socio-economic position,
	bloomed. At the end of this period, many different groups, whether it be the working
	class, middle-class, African American, or women, had started to take a stand and push
	for changes as a result of overwhelming corporate power.

	<h4> How did America approach Western expansion? </h4>
	
	<p>

	In approaching Western expansion, America had fought the Battle of Fallen Timbers,
	ending with the Treaty of Grenville. This earned the US lots of land west, however,
	British troops remained stationed in the territory and traded with the natives. This
	alliance between the British and Natives led to tensions culminating in the War of
	1812. The U.S. struggled to have consistency with natives, as they constantly break
	treaties, due to the lack of acknowledgement of natives in the Constitution.

	</p>

	<p>

	Tensions also emerged between the poorer western settlers and the Atlantic seaboard
	settlers. The Paxton boys had complete disregard for land ownership, including from
	the government and settled in the west. These people created tensions between
	this frontier culture and a more organized Atlantic seaboard community. Another
	example was Shays rebellion where poorer Western farmers had attacked the government.
	Generally, these tensions were fueld by the Western frontier being much less wealthy
	than the Atlantic seaboard, leading to these violent outbreaks.

	</p>

	<p>

	To incorporate the western territories into new states similar to the already 
	established states, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 was created. This provided
	public education, abolished slavery, protection of private property, and urged
	people to migrate westward. On the other side of North America, Spain expanded
	its influence over California during this time and many natives were converted
	to christianity and traded with the Spanish.

	</p>

	<h4> How did America react to European presence in North America? </h4>

	<p>

	With the Spanish still expanding and holding control of the Mississippi River
	and continued
	British presence, America looked to use diplomatic means to resolve the issues. Jay's
	Treaty was made to get the British out of western territories and established a
	better relationship between the British and the US. Pinckney's Treaty was made with
	Spain and guaranteed the rights to the Mississippi River.

	</p>

	<p>

	Amidst the French Revolution, however, the Federalists, supporters of Britain, and
	the Democratic Republicans, supporters of France, had arguments over the foreign 
	policy. Jay's treaty had seemed like the US was leaning towards Britain and had 
	angered Democratic Republicans. The Alien and Seditions Acts were so repulsive to
	them that the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions were drafted to nullify it. On the 
	other hand, actions to support France were not effective as seen through the XYZ
	Affair, Citizen Genet, and the the Quasi-war with France. Overall, the US stayed
	relatively neutral during the French Revolution besides a couple instances of 
	skewed initiatives.

	</p>

	<p>

	Before leaving office, Washington's Farewell Address tried to foster national unity
	to avoid political parties. He also warned to stay out of permanent foreign alliances.
	While the US had stayed out of foreign alliances for much of its history, America
	immediately developed political parties, and in this time period, the French Revolution
	had polarized the Federalists and Democratic Republicans. The US will continue to 
	stay out of foreign alliances and create strong opposing political parties for years
	to come.

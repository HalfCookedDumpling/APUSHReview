	<h4> How did political participation intensify? </h4>

	<p>

	Political participation manifested heavily in political parties. Early on, people
	united behind the Federalists and the Democratic Republicans. The Federalists favored
	tariffs to support the industry of their Northern base, a stronger Federal government,
	as can be seen in their support of the Bank of the United States, and were supportive
	of the British for trade. A prominent Federalist was Hamilton, which created the
	Bank of the United States, and most of their supporters were upper class. The 
	Democratic Republicans were not as fond of tariffs, supported states rights as seen
	with the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, and were supportive of the French. A
	prominent Democratic Republican was Thomas Jefferson, and most of their supporters
	were lower to middle class farmers from the South. These tensions intensified and
	culminated into conflicts over the War of 1812 against Britain. Democratic Republicans
	saw it as a way to display the US' independence while Federalists saw it as a threat
	to trade with Britain. Some radical Federalists had joined the Hartford Convention,
	a meeting to discuss secession from the Union. With one last victory for the Americans
	in New Orleans, this made the Federlists seem weak and established a one-party 
	"Era of Good Feelings."

	</p>

	<p> 

	In the "Era of Good Feelings," politics were generally unified, believing in 
	creating protective tariffs to support industry, a centralized bank, and internal
	improvements. This is known as the American System. There was consensus that the
	American system was beneficial and it had been implemented with the cumberland road
	and the Tariff of 1816.

	</p>

	<p>

	As the election of 1824 approached, the "Corrupt Bargain," as it was called by 
	Andrew Jackson, skewed the elction in the favor of John Quincy Adams. Due to this,	
	Andrew Jackson handily won the 1828 election as the people's president. From this,
	new political parties emerged with Jacksonian Democrats and Henry Clay's Whig party.
	Despite both parties wanting to create national unity, the Democrats were largely 
	against the American System. This can be seen with Jackson's attempt to eliminate
	the second Bank of the United States. The Whig's, on the other hand, had greatly
	supported the American system.

	</p>

	<p>

	Regional political participation intensified under these newly established political
	parties. The North had generally accepted the Whig party, especially with the tariffs,
	and the Democrats were based in the South, rejecting tariffs. One particular regional
	interest that had disregarded national interests was the Nullification Crisis and
	threatening of secession from South Carolina. This was headed by John C. Calhoun and	
	he greatly disapproved of the 1928 Tariff coined the Tariff of Abominations. However,
	outspoken nationalists like Jackson and Daniel Webster had emphasized national unity
	and the need for taking care of national concerns.

	</p>

	<p>

	During this time, the Supreme Court also gets more involved in politics. The root of 
	this was in the Marbury vs Madison case, which set the precedent of judicial review.
	Later, they participated in the McCulloch vs Maryland case which gave the Federal
	government more power over states as it upheld the constitutionality of the Second
	Bank of the United States and ruled that States can't tax the federal government.
	They also ruled in Ogden vs Gibbons that States had no rights over interstate
	commerce and that it was the Federal governments responsibility. 

	</p>

	


	<h4> How did new cultures emerge? </h4>

	<p>

	As a result of the Second Great Awakening, new cultures emerged to try to reach
	moral perfection. Utopian societies were experiments with this and can be seen
	with Oneidas. This also spawned social reforms working towards temperance and
	abolishment.

	</p>

	<p>

	New American culture also emerged which mixed the Western American frontier and nature
	with the European Romanticism. This influenced new cultural expressions of art like
	the Hudson River School. John James Audobon had advanced the study of birds in nature.
	Another large expression of this was the Transcendentalist movement which looked 
	towards nature to achieve personal perfection and connection with god. Influential 
	Transcendentalists include
	Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Transcendentalism was a mixture of 
	Romanticism, the Second Great Awakening, and the dreams of the nature out West. 

	</p>

	<p>

	While new forms of national art, literature, and culture around nature emerged,
	African Americans created their own cultures to try to retain autonomy, even with
	slavery. This can be seen in the surrogate families, which looked to create strong
	relationships between individuals torn from their familes in slavery. They also
	looked towards the Second Great Awakening for openings to be a priests or preachers
	to gain more autonomy.

	</p>

	<h4> How were reform movements influenced by the Second Great Awakening? </h4>

	<p>

	The Second Great Awakening prompted many social and moral reforms. One of which was
	the American Temperance society, which pushed for limitations of alcohol. Dorothea
	Dix pushed for moral reform and rehabilitation for the mentally ill. Horace Mann
	pushed for public education. The Shakers, a Christian community, practiced celibacy
	to become more morally pure.

	</p>

	<p>

	Besides those smaller movements, abolitionism started taking off with the Second
	Great Awakening. William Lloyd Garrison was a prominent printer that had pushed for
	abolitionism in his "Liberator." Others like Frederick Douglass wrote about the horrors
	of slavery. In the South, Nat Turner's Rebellion and Denmark Vesey's rebellions show
	antislavery sentiments growing with larger rebellions. Despite success in the North
	in many states emancipated African Americans, the South had limited success. These
	rebellions had failed to create any more autonomy for slaves and pro-slavery 
	sentiments, like John C. Calhouns argument that its a "positve good", persisted.

	</p>

	<p>

	The other massive movement was the Women's rights movements. Headed by people like
	Elizabeth Cady Stanton, this movement culminated in the Seneca Falls Convention, 
	which pushed for equality for women. A famous document from this was the Declaration
	of Sentiments, which was an adaptation of the Declaration of Independence to push
	for womens rights. Within these two social reform giants, there was cross support.
	An example of this would be Frederick Douglass attending the Seneca Falls Convention.

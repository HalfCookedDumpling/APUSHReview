	<h3> Summary </h3>

	<p>
		
	Period 7 was a test to America's allegiance to its core values. In this time period,
	America faced many dilemnas which forced the public to re-evaluate what they want.
	Such dilemnas include the Spanish-American War, the response to the Progressivism, 
	WWI, the Great Depression, and finally WW2. Over this half a century, America 
	tried to cling on to their isolationist tradition, but slowly gained support for
	emerging as an international power house. Furthermore, new rising cultures as well as
	immigrant cultures from Asia, Mexico, and Europe clashed with pre-existing cultures
	in America. With an industrial economy under a Laissez-faire policy, progressive 
	reformers looked to control all powerful corporations. Under this economic system,
	job opportunities and the economy skyrocketed during the time of WWI while personal 
	freedoms were restricted. However, the crash of the banks and the stock market had 
	left America's economy in shambles for over a decade until WWII. America had reached
	its highest of highs as well as the lowest of lows in this period. This period writes
	a chapter to America's rise to international dominance, incredible economic growth, 
	flourishing expansion of culture, and reformations to match the new booming society.
